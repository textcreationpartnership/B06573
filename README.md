1. Some particulars on the truths behalfe in love to the Inhabitants of Newcastle, which may concern many other parts of this Nation. This is given forth in Answer to a false Alarum sounded forth by a blind Watch-man named Samuel Hammond, a chiefe Priest of Newcastle, and a man of great repute in the Nation, who hath been set up for a tryer and examiner of the Priests: But his Spirit is tryed, and seen to be a false spirit, as also his Doctrine is, who in stead of warning people against their Enemies; hath warned them against the Truth, and such as be in it. For the clearing of whom, this was given forth by George VVhithead.

    _ Now concerning what this said Samuel Hammond hath layd down touching two or three of the Quakers Principles, as he calls them.

    _ Now concerning Christs Righteousnesse, and what S. Hammond about it hath layd to our charge, &c.

    _ Now concerning the Ordinances of Christ, and how S. Hammond hath accused us with denying of them; But he hath set up mens Traditions for Ordinances of Christ.
