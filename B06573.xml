            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>But with the Spirit of the Lord is he seen, and discovered to be a blind watch-man, and his Alarum false, and the sound uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; And if the Watch-man be blind, how can he keep the City, and give warning to the people when their Enemies comes?

            <p>Priest Hammond. <hi>He saith, That it is not their duty to medle with every Opinion, or Forme of men, or to take any notice of it; but when the Lord of Heaven comes to warn people of the Rage and Infusion of Sathan, (and saith he,) The way to keep your soules safe, is to live under the warnings of God.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> This is spoken in his Darknes, for God hath not damnation to call for at the hands of the wicked; for the wicked are not to condemn, for condemnation shall come upon them, and they are to be damned, and this condemnation cannot such

                     </gap> them, and that it excluds from Salvation, and that it is no way of God, and that there is no foot-hold for it in all the Book of God, and that there is no word of Scripture for it as he knows of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Here he hath greatly erred in a lying spirit concerning the light within which we Preach, manifesting his ignoranc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> concerning it, and the Scriptures; But against his errors and deceit, I here witnesse, for the light which we Preach is the light of Christ, which the Saints Preached, which is Christ, <hi>who doth enlighten every man that commeth into the world,</hi> and so much of this is manifest in the Creature as will reveal Christ in them, and save them that beleeve in it, and walk in it, as the Saints witnessed, who had Christ revealed in them, who is given a light that enlightens the Heathen who shall be his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: and as Christ said, <hi>Beleeve in the light, that ye may be the Children of the light:</hi> And Christ saith, <hi>I am the light of the world, which whosoever followeth me, shall not abide in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but shall have the light of life;</hi> but how can they follow Christ, if there be not a light to enlighten the darknesse? and how can they be inlightened, or have the light, if it be not in them? for the word is a light unto the paths, and a lanthorn to the feet, before it shine out of darknesse, is nigh, even in the heart; and this word was Preached to them that were out of the second Covenant, and this saveth, and justifieth them that beleeve, and continue in it, and will not condemn them, as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:179245:3"/>
                  <hi>S. H.</hi> blasphemously hath affirmed, for it condemns the world that loves darknesse rather then the light, which light is Christ the way of, and, to God, and whereby his Book may be opened, which is sealed from all the deceivers and haters of the light, and Gods Book hid from them.</p>
               <p>S. H. <hi>Also saith, That we mean by this light, that it is the light of a naturall Conscience that is left to all men; and saith, that a naturall Conscience is a dark blind guide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That is false, for by the light in man, we doe not mean a naturall Conscience that is left to all men; but what we say, and what I have said of the light, that it is the true light in the Conscience, without which, the Conscience cannot be puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from that which defiles the Conscience; but the light is pure, and cannot be defiled; and this is it whereby the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is to be exercised in the truth, towards God, and towards Man; so it is greater then the naturall Conscience: and though the naturall man knows not the things of God; yet the gift of God is given him, and thereby he may see his evill deeds; and as by the light man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> mind is turned, and he changed out of darknesse, he coms to see the things of God; but first, one thing of God is to be received, and known, which is the light, before the things of God be revealed; and though dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse comprehends not the light, yet it is known to shine in the darknesse, before it shine out of darknesse.</p>
               <p>S. Ham. <hi>I grant, saith he, that there's a principle of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall light, as to the managing of Justice; but not in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to justification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Here he would make two lights differing in kind, and yet their works are of one kind, if it be as he saith; for justice and justification doe arise from one ground; and without justice is no man justified; for justice is according to the Law of God; and the Law was spirituall, which was written in the Gentiles hearts, who did these things contained in the Law, and came to be justified; <hi>For it is the doers of the Law,</hi> or justice, <hi>that God justifies.</hi> But this blind guide, <hi>S. Hammond,</hi> affirms, That a naturall light manages justice;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:179245:4"/>when before he confessed, That it <hi>was a dark blind guide, and pure darknesse.</hi> Oh what absurdity is this! Was there ever such a Doctrine Preached, as that that <hi>which is a darke blind guide, and pure darknesse should manage justice?</hi> or that that <hi>which manageth justice,</hi> or leads any to doe it doth not justifie? and was that naturall, or spirituall? was it dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or Light, that led the Judges in <hi>Israel,</hi> and these that were sent of God to manage Justice? Let Priest <hi>Hammond</hi> and his hearers consider this, and be ashamed of his ignorance and falshood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. H.</hi> And he tells them, <hi>That the Scriptures send them to Christ, and that they are bid goe to Christ, but not to the light within; and if any man be a thirst, let him come unto me, saith Christ; and look up to me all the ends of the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Nay, the Scriptures have not sent you to Christ, if Christ be so far from you as this Priest thinks he is: For the Scriptures have never sent you to above, nor to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to the right hand of God as a far off; for while any doe deny comming to the light within, as this said Priest hath done, they come not to Christ, nor to answer the spirit, which saith, <hi>Come;</hi> not truely to look up to God for salvation; But its such as ask and look up in the light within, that comes to se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the salvation of God in looking up unto him. And the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of Faith directs not people to goe look abroad, or a far off for a Christ without, they know not where; as these blind guides doe, who Preach against the light of Christ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in men; for it forbids them to goe into the Deep, or to above, to fetch Christ from thence; But it saith, <hi>The word of Faith is nigh thee, even in thine heart, and in thy mouth to obey it, and to doe it,</hi> Rom. 10. And here they were to obey the light within them, and look to it. But this hath Priest <hi>Hammond</hi> denyed, for he saith, <hi>That a man cannot look upon Christ, nor live upon Christ, so long as he looks to the light within him, and lives upon that light.</hi> Here he would divide Christ and his light, and would have the light to be within a man, but not Christ; When as Christ saith, <hi>I am the light of the world;</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:179245:4"/>and <hi>Christ</hi> is revealed in us, and <hi>in his light we see light:</hi> so that it is by his light that he may be looked unto, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> cannot be divided from his light. Also this said Priest hath confessed, That <hi>Christ that sitteth in glory, is the righteousness<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of God fulfilled in you;</hi> and yet he hath denyed him, or his light to be within people; see his folly and confusion, and how he contradicts his own words! For, I say, If the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of <hi>Christ</hi> be fulfilled in any, it springeth up in the light; and the righteousnesse of the righteous springeth up as the morning. Also this said Priest hath contradicted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in saying, <hi>that Christ is the righteousnesse of a sinner;</hi> and yet hath denyed him to be the light of sinners, in his saying, that the light within people is a naturall Conscience, or a Naturall light. But I say, that <hi>Christ</hi> is spirituall, and not the righteousnesse of sinners, as he hath affirmed; but the righteousnesse of the saints: and the light which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of sinners. And so we mean not by Christ that he, or the light, is the improvement of Conscience wrought in a man, as the said Priest hath here wickedly and falsly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed us called <hi>Quakers</hi> with these things, which were never taught nor held forth by us. He also saith, <hi>That we tell you that every man hath Naturall light enough to bring him to Christ.</hi> This also is a filthy lye like his former, and so he may be reproved that he is a broacher of lyes to the people, if they question us of Christ.

               <p>S. H. <hi>Also this said blind guide saith, That Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> He that here hath affirmed <hi>the Grace of Christ to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Created in the heart;</hi> he might as well say then, That a created thing bringeth salvation; <hi>For the Grace of God hath appeared unto all men,</hi> which bringeth Salvation: but the Apostle doth not say, <hi>a created grace; and by the grace of God the Saints were freely justified:</hi> but this deceiving fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, hath denyed, That the grace within justifies a soule, but Christ without them! so he would divide Christ and his grace, it to be within, and Christ without, so this would make two Saviours; for the grace of God saveth and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, and so doth <hi>Christ,</hi> and this is but one, and that one becoms all to them that receives <hi>Christ,</hi> and walks in his righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>S. H. <hi>It is out of this, that a mans improving his naturall Conscience groweth up unto perfection, and is his righteousnesse with God; these are their very principles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is another lying Accusation, for that <hi>perfection</hi> which we own, stands not in the improvement <hi>of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Conscience,</hi> but in the righteousnesse of God with <hi>Christ,</hi> which no man can come to by his Naturall Conscience; neither can he be a true witnesse of that perfection, while he is in the naturall state; but this perfection is attainable to those that walk after the spirit of truth, and that come to see the commands of <hi>Christ</hi> fulfilled in them, who said, <hi>Be ye perfect, &amp;c.</hi> but this you earnall Priests doe deny, as thou Priest <hi>Hammond</hi> hast denyed that righteousnesse which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:179245:5"/>some have with God, and calls it, <hi>a desporate principle;</hi> but here thou art ignorant of Gods Righteousnesse, which is <hi>Christ</hi> in the Saints, who is the Righteousnesse of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and is made to us Wisedome, and Righteousnesse; and so <hi>Christ</hi> our Righteousnesse is with God, where no selfe-Righteousnesse can stand; and this is not a <hi>desperate principle,</hi> but according to the truth.</p>
               <p>S. Hammond. <hi>And I say it again, that if this principle be owned and lived in, it will Damne thee; for it leads a man to a perfect Covenant of Works: and I am confident these men live in a Covenant of Works; and if so, then there is no hopes of Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is all false, for that principle of light which we Preach leads into the covenant of life in <hi>Christ,</hi> from whence the good works proceed, and by which the Law of <hi>Christ</hi> is fulfilled in us; and that covenant we Preach, which Christ Jesus is given for, which stands not in the <hi>Works of the Law,</hi> but in him who is <hi>the end of the Law</hi> for Righteousnesse; and if any be in a perfect covenant of Works of the Law, the Priests have no cause to condemne them, as this Priest hath done us, from his false perswasion; for such goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the covetous Priests; for they are neither in a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, nor in the covenant of light; for this man hath set himselfe against the covenant of Works; and hath affirmed. That <hi>there is no hopes of salvation for them that be in that Covenant;</hi> which is false, For the Apostles prayed to God <hi>that Israel might be saved,</hi> though they sought after the Righteousnesse of the Law, by the Works of the Law, and went about to establish their own Righteousnesse, which thing this said Priest hath falsly charged us with. <hi>And that there's no hopes of salvation for us,</hi> as he hath said. But I tell him, That he that doth the Works of the Law is not condemned by the Law; but the transgressors of it, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with is: and if the <hi>Gallations</hi> had been as strict in all points of the Law, as they were in some, the Law would not have condemned them: and yet there was hope
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:179245:6"/>of Salvation for them; for it was in that hope that <hi>Paul</hi>

But the Priests goes beyond eating and drinking, and that in the world; for where they have never planted a Vineyard, they both eat and drink, and hire at places in the world, and there takes wages, and Teaches for hire, and receives Tythes, which is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Life, Doctrines, and Practises of Christ and his Apostles; so against such Teachers and Priests, did also the true Prophets of God beare witnesse. So you are manifest to be in the coveteousnesse, and the coveteous practises; and you live not of the Gospel, but makes of your preaching a Trade, as also you doe of the Scriptures. And whereas thou sayest, <hi>that</hi> Paul <hi>received wages of other Churches,</hi> and so thereby thou would cover thy deceit. <hi>I answer.</hi> This he counts as robbery; <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>I robbed other Churches, taking Wages of them, in so much, that he was not burthensome to the</hi> Corinthians, and bad them, <hi>forgive him that wrong.</hi> Now if <hi>Paul</hi> did account it robbery to receive reliefe of some of the Churches, and was to be forgiven for sparing others, upon that account: then he did not stand to justifie his so doing, though very probable his wages could not be great; neither could he upon that account be burthensome to them of whom he received reliefe, seeing that it was severall Churches that relieved him; and if he had food and rayment, he was therewith content: This was not a hiring with one people in a parish for many pounds a yeare, as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:179245:8"/>the Priests doe who Preach for hire; And thou art accusing thy Brethren <hi>at the grudging in their hearts with the maintenance you have, and that Sathan casts such thought into their hearts.</hi> Here thou hast little assurance on thy Brethrens parts, who before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Here he hath grosly perverted <hi>Pauls</hi> words, who here counts it <hi>a grosse delusion to try sin,</hi> manifesting himselfe not yet to have tryed sin: How then can he, or any such <hi>hold fast that which is good;</hi> and so here, he would keep others in blindnesse from the true light, that they might not discern between the pretious, and the vile; for he that commeth to the light, may diseern, and try spirits, works, words, opinions, and doctrines, and voyces, without running into the evill, though this false teacher imagines the contrary, and so would keep people under his teachings and false doctrines and reports, and would make them afraid <hi>to try all things,</hi> that they might neither come to the true light within to prove things, nor come to heare us, who direct people to the light and spirit of Christ which searcheth all things; so he that thus hath denyed the trying of all things, as mens opinions, and other things, he is clearly seen not to be a spirituall man, but a naturall man, that cannot discern nor try things; so would have his hearers to remain blind, as he doth.</p>
               <p>S. H. <hi>And now he hath given his meaning to the</hi> 1 Thes. 5.21. <hi>and saith, Try what is according to the mind of the Lord Iesus Christ, hold fast that; but if any thing be otherwise revealed, let that passe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is a false meaning to limit people from trying all things, and yet they must try what is according to the mind of Christ; but if they may not try what is contrary to the mind of Christ, then how can they come to try, what is according to the mind of Christ? and how may they know where to find Christs mind, or how to hold fast that which is good, if they may not trie sin, nor goe to heare such as they know not? nor never, it may be, have rightly heard them; but have heard many different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of them, which they know not which to beleeve! but said John, <hi>try the spirits, whether they be of God, or no:</hi> so they were
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:179245:9"/>to try both true spirits, and false ones, contrary to <hi>S.
